# tictactoe
The first project that I made with the help of JetBrains Academy. With some slight improvements, this small game can be quickly started by just running the .py file.

tictactoe.py is the first project, where you play by entering coordinates (2,2; 1,3; ...)
simple-ttt.py is a simplified version, where coordinates transformed into a 1-to-9 grid (5, 9, ...)
